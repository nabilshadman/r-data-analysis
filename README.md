# R Data Analysis Assignments

This repository contains R scripts for two data analysis assignments. The scripts demonstrate various data manipulation, analysis, and visualization techniques using R programming language.

## Environment Setup

1. **R and RStudio:** Ensure you have R and RStudio installed on your system.
2. **Install Required Packages:** If needed, install any required packages using the `install.packages()` function.

## Assignment 1: Data Analysis and Function Creation

### Overview

This [assignment](https://github.com/nabilshadman/r-data-analysis/tree/main/assignment1) focuses on creating functions for basic data manipulation and statistical analysis. The functions cover:

* **Circle Calculations:** Calculating area, circumference, volume, and surface area of circles and spheres.
* **Descriptive Statistics:** Computing summary statistics for numeric variables in a data frame.
* **Two-Sample T-Tests:** Performing t-tests to compare means of two groups.

### File Description

* **assignment1.R:** Contains the R code for the functions and their usage.
* **patient_num.RData:** Sample data file for the descriptive statistics function.
* **chol.txt:** Sample data file for the t-test function.

### Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Open RStudio:** Start RStudio and open the `assignment1.R` script.
3. **Load Data:** Load the `patient_num.RData` and `chol.txt` data files into your R environment.
4. **Run the Script:** Execute the code in the `assignment1.R` script to define and test the functions.

## Assignment 2: Data Cleaning and Analysis

### Overview

This [assignment](https://github.com/nabilshadman/r-data-analysis/tree/main/assignment2) focuses on data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis. The functions cover:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and outliers.
* **Data Manipulation:** Reshaping and merging data frames.
* **Statistical Analysis:** Performing correlation analysis and descriptive statistics.

### File Description

* **assignment2.R:** Contains the R code for the functions and their usage.
* **Assignment2.RData:** Sample data file containing multiple datasets.

### Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Open RStudio:** Start RStudio and open the `assignment2.R` script.
3. **Load Data:** Load the `Assignment2.RData` data file into your R environment.
4. **Run the Script:** Execute the code in the `assignment2.R` script to define and test the functions.

## **Additional Notes**

* The scripts are designed to be modular and reusable.
* You can modify and adapt the functions to fit your specific data analysis needs.
* For more detailed explanations and examples, refer to the comments within the R scripts.
